DESCRIPTION:
myxxd is a program to emulate the function of xxd with 3 options.

LANGUAGE:
C programming language with ANSI standard libraries supported.

SHELl:
Uses the bash shell.

FILES INCLUDED:
binary.c  binary.h  documentation  fileReader.c  fileReader.h  hexdump.c  hexdump.h  makefile  myxxd.c	readme script

HOW TO COMPILE:
Unzip s16csc520p2_gendreau.tar.gz
Once unzipped enter the myxxd directory
Use make to create the executable 

CLEAN:
Enter make clean

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Once compiled, enter the input as follows:
./myxxd [options] [infile [outfile]]

The following options are supported:

  -c cols || -cols where cols is the number of octets printed per line.

  -l len  || -l <len> is the number of octets to print in total, after writing len octets myxxd will stop.

   -b     || -bits This will switch to binary dump mode and print the octets in binary form in place of hex. 
		It prepend a hex line number before each line and append the acii version of that line.

KNOWN BUGS:
1. myxxd will only work with pre-given input files for now, it cannot do input from stdin.
2. myxxd does not format the final line like xxd does, if all the lines are not of equal length, the final line
will be smaller than the rest.
